### Hi there 👋 My name is Evan!
I am a multi-decade veteran of the software industry, with experience across a host of industries and disciplines from game development to embedded software and enterprise business applications.

#### <ins>My Superpower</ins> 🦸‍♂️
I am a voracious reader and lifelong student. I am a rapid learner and can go from "Hello World" to "Minimum-Viable-Product" faster than most.

#### <ins>Current Projects</ins> ⚒
- An online text-based multiplayer game, played in the browser, built using Blazor, SignalR and hosted in Azure.
  - A Blazor component library for gaming to support the project.
- A family meal-planning and grocery shopping mobile app to help my wife and I collect recipes that are "winners" for our family and add the ingredients to the shopping list as needed.
  - No, I don't really like the feature set on the ones currently out there in the app store, so I'm building my own.

#### <ins>Currently Learning</ins> 📚
- French: Adding vocabulary and getting better at my listening skills via DuoLingo and listening to French-speaking Twitch streamers.
- Microsoft Power Platform: Working on certifications, brainstorming ideas for leveraging this tool at work.
- Microsoft Azure: Same as above. Certifications and applying what I'm learning to the situation at the office.
